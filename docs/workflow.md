# LLM Training Workflow


This document provides a visual explanation of a common Large Language Model (LLM) training workflow, focusing on the iterative improvement approach. The workflow is depicted in the provided image and can be broken down into two main branches: the baseline approach (left) and the iterative improvement approach (right).

**Baseline Approach**

1. **Load Model, Try to Inference:**
   * Load a pre-trained LLM model.
   * Attempt to use the model for inference on a sample task.
   * This step provides a baseline understanding of the model's capabilities.

2. **Batch Test Before Training:**
   * Conduct a batch test on the pre-trained model to obtain a baseline performance metric.
   * This metric will be used for comparison with the trained model's performance.

3. **Preparing Dataset (Hist Plot):**
   * Prepare a dataset for training the LLM.
   * This involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and potentially data augmentation techniques.
   * Visualize the dataset using a histogram plot or other suitable methods to understand its distribution.

4. **Train Model (Log, Eval):**
   * Train the LLM on the prepared dataset.
   * Log training metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy) and evaluate the model's performance periodically.

5. **Inference by Trained Model:**
   * Use the trained LLM for inference on new tasks or data.
   * Evaluate the model's performance on these new tasks.

6. **Batch Test After Training:**
   * Conduct another batch test on the trained model to assess its final performance.
   * Compare this performance to the baseline metric obtained in step 2.

**Iterative Improvement Approach**

1. **Cite a Small Dataset:**
   * Start with a small, well-curated dataset to train a smaller LLM.

2. **Try with Small Model:**
   * Train a smaller LLM on the small dataset.
   * This allows for quicker experimentation and iteration.

3. **Expand the Dataset:**
   * If the small model's performance is not satisfactory, expand the dataset by adding more relevant data.

4. **Expand the Model:**
   * If the expanded dataset still doesn't yield satisfactory results, increase the model's complexity (e.g., by adding more layers or parameters).

5. **Repeat Steps 3 and 4:**
   * Iteratively expand the dataset and model complexity until the desired performance is achieved.

**Key Considerations and Best Practices**

* **Data Quality:** Prioritize data quality and diversity to ensure model robustness.
* **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate LLM architecture based on the task and available resources.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.
* **Regularization:** Employ regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
* **Early Stopping:** Monitor training metrics and stop training when performance plateaus.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models to improve overall performance.
* **Continuous Learning:** Continuously update and retrain the LLM with new data to maintain its effectiveness.

**Conclusion**

This LLM training workflow provides a structured approach to building and improving large language models. By following this workflow and considering the best practices, you can develop powerful LLMs that can excel in various natural language processing tasks.
